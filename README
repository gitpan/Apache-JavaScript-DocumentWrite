SYNOPSIS
     PerlTransHandler Apache::JavaScript::DocumentWrite

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::JavaScript::DocumentWrite is a mod_perl handler to output HTML
    (or plain text) file as a JavaScript document.write file. This module
    helps you to do client-side SSI using JavaScript.

    For example, you have a HTML file generated from RSS with crontab in

      http://example.com/rss.html

    access to

      http://example.com/rss.html.js

    gives you document.write version of rss.html. Thus it can be embedded
    into another HTML file using SCRIPT html tag like:

      <script src="http://example.com/rss.html.js"></script>
